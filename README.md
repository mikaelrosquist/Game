# Space Invaders in C++
Written for an assignment in a programming course. The task was to create a game engine along with a 2D game, that would be as generically written as possible so that future changes could be done with less effort. We chose to make a version of the classic game Space Invaders. It's written in C/C++ and uses the SDL framework.

Game
====

Written by me and two classmates for an assignment. The task was to create a game engine and a 2D game that would be as generically written as possible, so that future changes could be done without too much effort. We chose to do a remake of the classic game Space Invaders. It's written in C/C++ and uses the SDL framework.
